# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Effigy got up with clothing
Abstracted from the victim's room
Is raised aleft to cheers of loathing
Before it meets a flaming doom

The Hermit lives among the boulders, He wears no grament but a sack;
By low degrees his reason moulders, The sun has long since burnt him black.

The Lazar, blessed with an appearanceEnough to give the strongest qualms, 
Has little need of perseverance in promting a display of alms.

The Quarry, fleeing from the outing,
Sinks panting in the reeds and mud:
And hearkens to the distant shouting
That tells him they are out for blood

The sight of Uncle gives no pleasure, 
But rather causes much alarm:
The children know that at his leisure
He plans to have them come to harm.
